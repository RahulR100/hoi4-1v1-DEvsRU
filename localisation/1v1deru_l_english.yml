	pla.3.t:0 "Do you want resources from the trade republic?"
	pla.3.d:0 "Some high ranking members of our Army think it will be a good idea to trade with the neutral trade republic to gain access to more resources. Others disagree stating that this will cost our civillian production dearly and that we should instead focus on remaining autarkic, and wish to use our political might to stop the trade republic from exporting goods at all, crippling the Soviet war effort. They have approached you, the Führer for a final decision on the matter."

	pla.4.t:0 "Do you want the border to be de-militarised?"
	pla.4.d:0 "Our eastern border will be completely de-militarised. The Soviets will not be able to see our troops and will not be entrenched once the war starts. However, similar penalties apply to us. Advisors further note that de-militarising the border now will cut off northern Estonia from the rest of the Reich, making us heavily dependent on the 2 nearby naval ports for supply. How do we proceed? \n\nNote, if either side opts to de-militarise, both sides of the border will be de-militarised."

However, similar penalties apply to us. Advisors further note that de-militarising the border will cut off northern Estonia from the rest of the German Reich.
